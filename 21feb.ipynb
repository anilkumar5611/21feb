    "# Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "# Web Scraping:\n",
    "# Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites by fetching and parsing the HTML code of web pages. It allows automated extraction of information, often for purposes such as data analysis, research, or populating databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Web Scraping is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Extraction: Web scraping is used to extract data from websites when APIs are not available or do not provide the required data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Competitor Analysis: Businesses use web scraping to gather information about competitors, prices, and product details from e-commerce websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Research and Analysis: Researchers and analysts use web scraping to collect data for studies, reports, and market trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Three Areas Where Web Scraping is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# E-commerce: Scraping product details, prices, and customer reviews for market analysis and pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Job Portals: Extracting job listings, company information, and salary data for analysis and research.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Social Media: Gathering data from social media platforms for sentiment analysis, user behavior, and content trends.\n",

    "# Manual Scraping: Manually copying and pasting information from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Regular Expressions: Using regular expressions to match and extract specific patterns from HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "# HTML Parsing: Using libraries like Beautiful Soup and lxml to parse HTML and extract desired data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Browser Automation: Tools like Selenium simulate a web browser to interact with web pages and extract data.\n",

    "# Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "# Beautiful Soup:\n",
    "# Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. Beautiful Soup transforms complex HTML documents into a tree of Python objects, such as tags, navigable strings, or comments, making it easy to navigate and search the HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Beautiful Soup is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# HTML Parsing: Beautiful Soup is specifically designed for HTML parsing, making it easy to navigate and search HTML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flexible: It works with various parsers, including Python's built-in parser, lxml, and html5lib.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convenient Syntax: Beautiful Soup provides a convenient syntax for searching and manipulating the parse tree, making it easy for developers to extract the desired information.\n",

    "# Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "# Flask in Web Scraping Project:\n",
    "# Flask is a micro web framework for Python, and it might be used in a web scraping project for various reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "# API for Data Access: Flask can be used to create a simple API to expose the scraped data. This allows other applications or services to easily consume the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Web Interface: Flask can provide a web interface to visualize or interact with the scraped data. This is particularly useful for debugging, testing, or presenting the information to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Integration with Frontend: If the web scraping project involves creating a user interface, Flask can be used to serve the frontend and handle interactions with the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Task Scheduling: Flask can be used to schedule and run scraping tasks at specific intervals using tools like Celery or APScheduler.\n",

    "# Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project. Also, explain the use of each service.\n",
    "# In a web scraping project hosted on AWS, various services may be utilized. Here are a few AWS services commonly used:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use: Hosting the web scraping application.\n",
    "# Explanation: EC2 provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. It's suitable for hosting applications, including web scraping scripts.\n",
    "# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use: Storing scraped data.\n",
    "# Explanation: S3 is a scalable object storage service. Scraped data can be stored in S3 buckets, providing durability, availability, and easy access.\n",
    "# Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use: Storing structured data.\n",
    "# Explanation: RDS is a managed relational database service. If the scraped data needs to be stored in a relational database, RDS can be used.\n",
    "# AWS Lambda:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use: Running serverless functions.\n",
    "# Explanation: Lambda allows running code without provisioning or managing servers. It can be used to execute web scraping tasks or data processing functions.\n",
    "# Amazon CloudWatch:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use: Monitoring and logging.\n",
    "# Explanation: CloudWatch provides monitoring and logging services. It can be used to monitor EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and other AWS resources.\n",
    "# Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use: Managing a queue of scraping tasks.\n",
    "# Explanation: SQS is a fully managed message queuing service. It can be used to queue and decouple tasks in a distributed system, such as web scraping tasks.\n",
    "# Note: The specific AWS services used depend on the requirements and architecture of the web scraping \n",
